# Next Generation Front-End for WooCommerce

> **Note** This is the first iteration of the new WooNuxt built on Nuxt 3. It's under active development and has a lot of features still to be added. You can use the old version of WooNuxt on the [v2 branch](https://github.com/scottyzen/woonuxt/tree/v2) which is more stable.

&nbsp;

## Introduction

The goal of WooNuxt is to provide a modern, fast, and SEO friendly front-end for WooCommerce. It's built on top of Nuxt 3 and uses the WPGraphQL API to retrieve all the data it needs. It's also fully customizable and can be extended with your own components and modules. You can see a live demo of WooNuxt by clicking the button below.
